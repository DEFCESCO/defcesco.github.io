                <h2>Background</h2>
		<p>His passion for Cybersecurity began in 2003 when his father purchased an Alienware Area-51 personal computer. This early exposure, coupled with his relentless pursuit of knowledge in middle and high school, where he wrote numerous papers on Cybersecurity and cyber policy, is a testament to his enduring dedication to the field.</p>
		<p>He started his first IT job in 2013 during middle and high school summers. He interned in the IT departments of local institutions, gaining invaluable hands-on experience and further solidifying his understanding of the field. Austin's practical approach to learning also led him to pursue an entrepreneurial venture to form a server rental company distributed across the US, UK, and AU. This company utilized a custom LAMP stack and content distribution network (CDN). Austin was then a system administrator at a Fortune 5000 company. His subsequent experience in the Global Research & Innovation department at RSM was his first focused exposure to Cybersecurity. The following summer, he conducted penetration tests. After that, Austin became a cybersecurity architect in the manufacturing space. Finally, he joined the Cleveland Clinic as a red team operator on the Threat Simulation team.</p>
